# FKHS - Football King of the Hill Simulator
## This app will generate a league starting with 21 teams and will end with only the one who manages to survive

### Reasoning and Inspiration
This is a project for the **Object Oriented Programming** class and is inspired from the **FIFA games carrer mode**, main differences being that teams are "randomly generated" and that this app only simulates matches.

### Introduction
The app starts by generating the teams and players for the league, every week teams will play matches, train their players and rest them.
Mid season the **transfer window** emerges and teams can buy and sell players for a period of 4 weeks(4 matches). Mid season is also the time for **player potential** changes, the top half get potential boosts, the bottom half get nerfs. At the end of the season the last three teams are *"relegated"*(removed from the league) and so after a few seasons we will have our **KING TEAM**.
