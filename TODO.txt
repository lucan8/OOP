#Precompile shaders once they are a lot
#In order to find wheter two opposing players intersect get the pixels near the player
and check if they are the same color

#Make entity a class that has a texture, vao, ibo, shader, position, radius
#Change formations to look better
#Add rotation to the player squares
#Team aura is determined by the average team_color
#Give an error radius for player passing
#Add dribbling
#Add template function min2

#Move one player from each team, not the whole team1 and then team2
#Make constructor for MatchPlayer thata accepts only 2 params and determines the 3 based on position
#Make function that returns a player_ptr depending on player type(for matchPlayer as well)
#Change stats_ratios to stats_weights
#Make vector<season*> unique_ptr and active season as well
#Generate raw pointers instead of making functions for each type of smart pointers
#Make a template function for cloning a vector
