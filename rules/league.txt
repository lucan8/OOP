#Generates season when app starts
#Every week a match will be played
#Depending on match result points will be aquired to move on the table(real football rules)
#Each season 3 teams get "relegated"(deleted) from the league
#This goes on until one team remains
#Each season will be kept in a vector
#Not using pointers(for teams and players) for the sake of saving the season as it is
