#match v1
#In a match there will be a number of chances
#Which team will have a goal scoring change is based on these attr:
    -PAS
    -STA

#After that it's time for the attackers and defenders to compare attributes:
    -PHY    -PHY
    -PAC    -AGG
    -DRI    -DEF
#If the attackers manage to go past the defense they need to go past the goalkeeper
    -SHO    -AVG(REF, DIV, HAN, POS)




#Every match will have 90 minutes
#After each minute the player stamina decreases depending on their statistical_stamina and poz
#Range for chances between 10, 40 per match
#Idea: Make football pitch a matrix and players points in matrix
#Idea: Formations will be graphs
#In each minute of a game a few things can happen:
    - team1/team2 has possesion
    - team1/team2 is attacking(so the other is defending)
    - team1/team2 commits a foul

#There will be a number between (10 - 30) fauls(average number is 20 in premier league)
#The chance of getting a yellow(or red) card grows with the number of fauls commited
#Every match has 9 scoring oportunities(every 10 minutes a scoring chance appears)
