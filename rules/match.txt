#The football pitch is a matrix
#Each player is node in the matrix
#Depending on the distance between players a transition will appear in adiacence matrix for the players

Attacking Team:
#With ball movement:
    - players with lower PAS have a higher probability of passing near the outer part of the radius
    - if a pass is sent where two players'es radius overlap,
        the player with the highest PHY will have a higher chance of keeping the ball
    case 1:Player with ball is closest to the goal
        - no opponent in front of him -> he can advance
        - an opponent in front of him -> he can pass or dribble
        - at least two opponets blocking the player -> passes automatically
    case 2: Player with ball is not closest to the goal
        - passes to closest player to the goal that has the highest probability of receiving the ball
        - if "blocked" the chance of keeping the ball is dependent on the player's PHY and DRI:

    Passing:
        - the probability of sending a succesfull pass depends on the player's PAS and the distance to a teammate
        - 

#With no ball movement:
    - players can intercept a pass if the ball is withing their radius
    - each player moves towards the goal
    - they will try to avoid opponets using their PAC
    - CBs don't go past middle of pitch
    - 2 players closest to player with ball stay within their passing range

Defending Team:
    - Players closest to the one with the ball will move towards him
    - The rest will block passing lanes and will mark their opponents
    - If withing the player's radius, they will try to intercept the pass

#Dictonary:
    - succesfull dribbling depenents on the player's DRI, PHY and PAC VS the opponent's DEF, PHY and PAC
    - how much a player advances at once depends on the player's PAC
    "blocked player" - the player's center is within an opponent's radius
