#Generating players:
    - 6-9 will be 16-22 years, stat: between(min_stat, max_stat - 29) potential: between(ovr + 10, MAX_pot)
    - 6-12 will be 23-29 years, stat: between(min_stat + 20, max_stat-19), potential: between(ovr + 5, MAX_pot)
    - 6-9 will be 30-35 years, stat: between(min_stat + 40, max_stat-9), potential: between(ovr, MAX_pot)
    - 2 GK randomly from the ranges above

#Choosing poz:
    - OVR and poz is determined after the player has been generated
    - The poz with the highest ovr will be chosen as the main
    - Idea: Poz is determined before match
