GENERAL:
#lasts 1 month(4 matches)
#players become uneligable for transfers if they were bought/sold until next season
#every day each team has the chance for transfer
#with every transfer completed the chance for the next goes down
#chosing randomly the order of team transfer chances
#Teams will look for transfers depending on what they lack and on their budget

NEGOTIATIONS:
#A team makes an offer to another for their player(close to the actual player value)
#Depending on the offer the team has a higher chance of accepting
#Can't make offers for positions that don't have at least 3 players(we still need to have a starting 11)
#The acception chance depends also on the number of back-ups available
